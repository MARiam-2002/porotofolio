# 🛠️ Error Fix Summary - Portfolio Website

## 🚨 Problem Identified
The application was showing "Oops! Something went wrong" error page instead of loading properly.

## 🔧 Root Causes & Solutions Applied

### 1. **React Strict Mode Issues** ✅
**Problem**: React.StrictMode was causing double renders and potential errors in production
**Solution**: Removed React.StrictMode from main.tsx to prevent production issues

### 2. **Complex Initialization Logic** ✅
**Problem**: Over-complicated app initialization with Suspense and multiple error handlers
**Solution**: Simplified main.tsx to basic React rendering without unnecessary complexity

### 3. **Missing Navigation & Footer** ✅
**Problem**: Layout component was missing Navigation and Footer components
**Solution**: Added Navigation and Footer imports to Layout.tsx

### 4. **Browser API Safety** ✅
**Problem**: Unsafe access to `window`, `document`, and `localStorage` without checks
**Solution**: Added proper type checks for browser APIs in:
- LanguageContext.tsx
- ThemeContext.tsx  
- api.ts

### 5. **Error Boundary Improvements** ✅
**Problem**: Limited error logging and debugging information
**Solution**: Enhanced ErrorBoundary with better logging and component stack traces

### 6. **Configuration Management** ✅
**Problem**: Hardcoded configuration values scattered throughout the app
**Solution**: Created centralized app configuration in `src/config/app.ts`
